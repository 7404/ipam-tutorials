      "The Contrastive Divergence algorithm for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) looks a lot like an auto-encoder from an algorithmic perspective, especially the denoising autoencoder. Tempting though it is to use the autoencoder as a unifying framework, it is a stretch to call an RBM an auto-encoder. Mathematically, it is better to train an RBM by Persistent CD (aka Stochastic Maximum Likelihood) and these methods actually work on the basis of ensuring that the RBM does *not* perfectly reconstruct any training instances. Nevertheless,\n",

      "One important difference with the cases above is that\n",
      "_CD is not in fact gradient descent on a cost function_ and although this code makes use of a difference in free energies as a cost function, it is just a trick.\n",
      "Consequently, you'll see that the so-called \"cost\" values regularly jump both up and down even when the algorithm is working perfectly well. Computation of the likelihood of an RBM involves an infamously intractable partition function -- there are techniques for estimating it (see Ruslan Salakhutdinov's PhD thesis), but no tutorial here yet."

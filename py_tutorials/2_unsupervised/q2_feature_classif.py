# Question 2 - Hooking up a classifier.
#    Step 1 - classify features with a linear SVM
#    Step 2 - classify features with a multi-layer classifier
#    Step 3 - realize you could do backprop through the whole system if you
#             wanted to....
#    Step 4 - consider - if your top layer features can achieve zero
#             training error, might it still be interesting to do whole-system
#             fine-tuning by backpropagation until that zero training error is
#             reached?

# Which feature-learning method yields the lowest error?
#   Think about all of the significant choices that go into this
#   answer:
#   - data set (encoding, nature of signal)
#   - feature-learning hyperparameters
#   - supervised learning algorithm on top
#    (This isn't really a homework question - interest in this question is one
#    of the major themes of the workshop)

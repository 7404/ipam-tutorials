Tutorial on Deep-Learning: from Supervised to Unsupervised
==========================================================

This directory contains four tutorials, which intend to teach
how to train deep-learning models using supervised and unsupervised
techniques, using [Torch7](http://www.torch.ch).

These tutorials should be read/done in order.

The tutorials were designed for the IPAM Summer School on
Deep Learning: [more info here.](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/gss2012/).

  * [Day 1: Setup / Basics / Getting Started](0_getstarted/README.html)
  * [Day 2: Supervised Learning](1_supervised/README.html)
  * [Day 3: Unsupervised Learning](2_unsupervised/README.html)
  * [Day 4: Putting it all together](3_morestuff/README.html)

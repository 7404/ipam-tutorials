<h1 id="unsupervised-learning">Unsupervised Learning</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we're going to learn how to define a model, and train it using an unsupervised approach, with the goal of learning good features/representation for classification tasks. Some of the material here is based on this <a href="http://torch.cogbits.com/doc/tutorials_unsupervised/">existing tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>The tutorial demonstrates how to: * describe an unsupervised model * define a (multi-term) loss function to minimize * define a sampling procedure (stochastic, mini-batches), and apply one of several optimization techniques to train the model's parameters * use second-order information (diagonal of the hessian) to ease the optimization procedure</p>

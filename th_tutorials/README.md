Tutorials on Deep-Learning: from Supervised to Unsupervised Learning
====================================================================

These tutorials were designed for the IPAM Summer School on
Deep Learning: [more info here.](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/gss2012/).

This directory contains four tutorials, which intend to teach
how to train deep-learning models using supervised and unsupervised
techniques, using [Torch7](http://www.torch.ch).

The Torch tutorials are less interactive than the IPython ones. Rather,
they give you complete end-to-end programs, which you can use
as a solid starting point to develop your own programs/scripts.

These tutorials should be read/done in order.

This text can be browsed either from the html files, or directly on GitHub,
by navigating through the
[directory structure](https://github.com/clementfarabet/ipam-tutorials/tree/master/th_tutorials).

__If you're reading this on GitHub, you won't see the Math properly rendered,
